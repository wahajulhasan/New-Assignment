                    Tennis is played between two (singles) or four players (doubles), who use rackets 
                    to hit a ball over a net into the opponentâ€™s court. The goal is to make it hard for 
                    the opponent to return the ball properly. Points are scored in sets, and the first to 
                    win a certain number of sets wins the match. Think of it as intense ping-pong with 
                    more runningâ€”and cooler headbands! ðŸ˜Ž
